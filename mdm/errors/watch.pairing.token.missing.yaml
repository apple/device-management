    The schema for a JSON or property list XML document returned in an MDM server's 403 response body. The response headers
    must include a "Content-Type" header indicating whether JSON or XML is being returned.

    This response is returned when an Apple Watch is attempting to enroll in MDM and the watch did not include a pairing token
    in the machine info request sent to the server to initiate enrollment. After receiving this response, the watch will fetch
    a pairing token from the phone's MDM server via a request to the phone. The watch will then repeat the enrollment request
    with the pairing token included.
