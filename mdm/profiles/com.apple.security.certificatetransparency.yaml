  content: Policies that affect system-wide certificate transparency enforcement.
payloadkeys:
- key: DisabledForCerts
  title: Disabled Certs
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    An array of certificates for which certificate transparency is disabled. For Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, one of the following conditions must be met:
    * The hash is of the server certificate's 'subjectPublicKeyInfo'.
    * The hash is of a 'subjectPublicKeyInfo' that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain; the CA certificate is constrained through the X.509v3 'nameConstraints' extension; one or more 'directoryName' 'nameConstraints' are present in the 'permittedSubtrees;' and the 'directoryName' contains an 'organizationName' attribute.
    * The hash is of a 'subjectPublicKeyInfo' that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain; the CA certificate has one or more 'organizationName' attributes in the certificate 'Subject;' and the server's certificate contains the same number of 'organizationName' attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.
  subkeys:
  - key: SubjectPublicKeyInfoHashDict
    type: <dictionary>
    subkeys:
    - key: Algorithm
      type: <string>
      presence: required
      rangelist:
      - sha256
      content: The algorithm must be 'sha256'.
    - key: Hash
      type: <data>
      presence: required
      content: |-
        The hash of the DER-encoding of the certificate's 'subjectPublicKeyInfo'.
        The hash field requires the data ('subjectPublicKeyInfo' hash) in a specific format: a Base64 encoded (binary) SHA-256 hash of the certificate's public key.
- key: DisabledForDomains
  title: Disabled domains
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    An array of strings representing the domains to be excluded from certificate transparency enforcement. A leading period (.) is supported to signify subdomains.
    Wildcard domains are not supported. If a leading period (.) is specified, the domain cannot be a top-level domain (for example, '.com' and '.co.uk' are disallowed).

  - key: domain
    type: <string>
