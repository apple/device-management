  content: Use this payload to specify settings that allow the device to request a
    client certificate from an ACME server. The device generates an asymmetric key
    pair based upon the KeyType, KeySize, and HardwareBound fields. If attest is true
    it requests an attestation of the key and device properties. Then it communicates
    with the ACME server to authenticate the device, provide the attestation, and
    request a matching certificate based upon the ClientIdentifier, Subject, SubjectAltName,
    UsageFlags, and ExtendedKeyUsage fields. The ACME server issues a certificate
    and the device installs it in the keychain. Other payloads can reference the resulting
    client identity by the payload's PayloadUUID. For details on the content of the
    attestation provided to the ACME server, see the documentation of the DevicePropertiesAttestation
    key in the DeviceInformation response. In the attestation certificate the value
    of the freshness code OID matches the nonce specified by the ACME server via the
    ACME protocol.
payloadkeys:
- key: DirectoryURL
  title: ACME directory URL
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: The directory URL of the ACME server. The URL must use the https scheme.
- key: ClientIdentifier
  title: Client identifier
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: A unique string identifying a specific device. The server may use this
    as an anti-replay code to prevent issuing multiple certificates. This identifier
    also indicates to the ACME server that the device has access to a valid client
    identifier issued by the enterprise infrastructure. This can help the ACME server
    determine whether to trust the device. Though this is a relatively weak indication
    because of the risk that an attacker can intercept the client identifier.
- key: KeySize
  title: Key Size
  type: <integer>
  presence: required
  content: The valid values for 'KeySize' depend on the values of 'KeyType' and 'HardwareBound'.
    See those keys for specific requirements.
- key: KeyType
  title: Key Type
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  rangelist:
  - RSA
  - ECSECPrimeRandom
  content: |-
    The type of key pair to generate. Allowed values:

    * 'RSA': Specifies an RSA key pair. RSA key pairs need to have a 'KeySize' that's a multiple of 8 in the range of 1024 through 4096 (inclusive), and 'HardwareBound' needs to be 'false'.
    * 'ECSECPrimeRandom': Specifies a key pair on the P-192, P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves as defined in FIPS Pub 186-4. 'KeySize' defines the particular curve, which needs to be '192', '256', '384', or '521'. Hardware bound keys only support values of '256' and '384'.
    Note that the key size is '521', not '512', even though the other key sizes are multiples of 64.
- key: HardwareBound
  title: Hardware Bound
  type: <boolean>
  presence: required
  content: |-
    If 'false', the private key isn't bound to the device.
    If 'true', the private key is bound to the device. The Secure Enclave generates the key pair, and the private key is cryptographically entangled with a system key. This prevents the system from exporting the private key.
    If 'true', 'KeyType' must be 'ECSECPrimeRandom' and 'KeySize' must be 256 or 384.
    Setting this key to 'true' is supported as of macOS 14 on Apple Silicon and Intel devices that have a T2 chip. Older macOS versions or other Mac devices require this key but it must have a value of 'false'.
- key: Subject
  title: Subject
  type: <array>
  presence: required
  content: |-
    The device requests this subject for the certificate that the ACME server issues. The ACME server may override or ignore this field in the certificate it issues.
    The representation of a X.500 name represented as an array of OID and value. For example, '/C=US/O=Apple Inc./CN=foo/1.2.5.3=bar' corresponds to:
    '[ [ [”C”, “US”] ], [ [”O”, “Apple Inc.”] ], ..., [ [ “1.2.5.3”, “bar” ] ] ]'
    Dotted numbers can represent OIDs , with shortcuts for country (C), locality (L), state (ST), organization (O), organizational unit (OU), and common name (CN).
  subkeys:
  - key: ACMESubjectArrayInnerArray
    title: Array Inside ACME Subject Array
    type: <array>
    subkeys:
    - key: ACMESubjectArrayPair
      title: Subject Array Pair
      type: <array>
      subkeys:

        title: ACME Subject Array Pair Item
        type: <string>
        repetition:
          min: 2
          max: 2
- key: SubjectAltName
  title: Subject Alt Name
  type: <dictionary>
  presence: optional
  content: The Subject Alt Name that the device requests for the certificate that
    the ACME server issues. The ACME server may override or ignore this field in the
    certificate it issues.
  subkeys:
  - key: rfc822Name
    title: RFC 822 Name
    type: <string>
    presence: optional
    content: The RFC 822 (email address) string.
  - key: dNSName
    title: DNS Name
    type: <string>
    presence: optional
    content: The DNS name.
  - key: uniformResourceIdentifier
    title: URI
    type: <string>
    presence: optional
    content: The Uniform Resource Identifier.
  - key: ntPrincipalName
    title: NT Principal Name
    type: <string>
    presence: optional
    content: The NT principal name.
- key: UsageFlags
  title: Key Usage
  type: <integer>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    This value is a bit field.
    * Bit '0x01' indicates digital signature.
    * Bit '0x04' indicates encryption.
    The device requests this key for the certificate that the ACME server issues. The ACME server may override or ignore this field in the certificate it issues.
- key: ExtendedKeyUsage
  title: Extended Key Usage
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    The value is an array of strings. Each string is an OID in dotted notation. For instance, '[”1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2”, “1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4”]' indicates client authentication and email protection.
    The device requests this field for the certificate that the ACME server issues. The ACME server may override or ignore this field in the certificate it issues.
  subkeys:
  - key: OID
    type: <string>
    presence: optional
- key: Attest
  title: Attest
  supportedOS:
    watchOS:
      introduced: '10.0'
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: false
  content: |-
    If 'true', the device provides attestations that describe the device and the generated key to the ACME server. The server can use the attestations as strong evidence that the key is bound to the device, and that the device has properties listed in the attestation. The server can use that as part of a trust score to decide whether to issue the requested certificate.
    When 'Attest' is 'true', 'HardwareBound' also needs to be 'true'.
    Setting this key to 'true' is supported as of macOS 14. Older macOS versions require this key but it must have a value of 'false'.\nSee the ACME attestation hardware support note for hardware requirements.

    visionOS:
      introduced: n/a
    watchOS:
      introduced: n/a
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: true
  content: If 'true', the private key of the identity obtained through Simple Certificate
    Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) needs to be tagged as “non-extractable” in the keychain.
