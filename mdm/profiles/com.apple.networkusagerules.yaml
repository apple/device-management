  content: Network Usage Rules allow enterprises to specify how devices use networks,
    such as cellular data networks. iOS 9-12 support only ApplicationRules. In iOS
    13, ApplicationRules, SIMRules, or both must be present.
payloadkeys:
- key: ApplicationRules
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: An array of application rules, that apply to only managed apps.
  subkeys:
  - key: ApplicationRulesItem
    type: <dictionary>
    subkeys:
    - key: AppIdentifierMatches
      type: <array>
      presence: optional
      content: |-
        A list of managed app identifiers, as strings, that must follow the associated rules. If this key is missing, the rules apply to all managed apps on the device.

        Each string in the 'AppIdentifierMatches' array may either be an exact app identifier match (for example, 'com.mycompany.myapp') or it may specify a prefix match for the bundle ID by using the * wildcard character. If used, this character must appear after a period (.) and may only appear once, at the end of the string; for example, 'com.mycompany.*'.
      subkeys:
      - key: AppIdentifierMatchesItem
        type: <string>
        presence: required
        content: A managed app identifier.
    - key: AllowRoamingCellularData
      type: <boolean>
      presence: optional
      default: true
      content: If 'false', disables cellular data while roaming for all matching managed
        apps.
    - key: AllowCellularData
      type: <boolean>
      presence: optional
      default: true
      content: If 'false', disables cellular data for all matching managed apps.
- key: SIMRules
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      introduced: '13.0'
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: An array of SIM rules, that apply to all apps.
  subkeys:
  - key: SIMRulesItem
    type: <dictionary>
    subkeys:
    - key: ICCIDs
      type: <array>
      presence: required
      content: One or more ICCIDs of SIM cards for which the 'WiFiAssistPolicy' applies.
        All ICCIDs in all installed Network Usage Rules payloads must be unique. An
        example ICCID is '89310410106543789301'.
      subkeys:
      - key: ICCID
        type: <string>
        presence: required
        content: An ICCID.
    - key: WiFiAssistPolicy
      type: <integer>
      presence: required
      rangelist:
      - 2
      - 3
      content: |-
        The Wi-Fi Assist policy to apply to the SIM cards specified in the ICCIDs. Allowed values:

        * '2': Use the default system policy for the specified SIM card(s).
        * '3': Make Wi-Fi Assist switch more aggressively from a poor Wi-Fi connection to cellular data for the specified SIM card(s). This setting may increase cellular data use and may impact battery life.
