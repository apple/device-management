  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    An array of certificates that the system checks for revocation.
    Specifying a certificate authority (CA) enables revocation checking for all certificates chaining up to that CA.
    It is not necessary to specify trusted root certificates because they are implicitly specified. See <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209143> for the available trusted root certificates for Apple operating systems.

      presence: required
      content: |-
        The hash of the DER-encoding of the certificate's 'subjectPublicKeyInfo'.
        The hash field requires the data ('subjectPublicKeyInfo' hash) in a specific format: a Base64 encoded (binary) SHA-256 hash of the certificate's public key.
