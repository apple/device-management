payloadkeys:
- key: PayloadIdentifier
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: The reverse-DNS style identifier ('com.example.myprofile', for example)
    that identifies the profile. The system uses this string to determine whether
    to replace an existing profile or add it as a new profile.
- key: PayloadUUID
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: The globally unique identifier for the profile. The actual content is unimportant.
    In macOS, you can use 'uuidgen' to generate reasonable UUIDs.
- key: PayloadType
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  rangelist:
  - Configuration
  content: The type of payload. The only supported value is 'Configuration'.
- key: PayloadVersion
  type: <integer>
  presence: required
  rangelist:
  - 1
  content: The version number of the profile format, which needs to be '1'. This number
    represents the version of the configuration profile as a whole, not of the individual
    profiles within it.
- key: IsEncrypted
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: false
  content: Set to 'true' if the profile is encrypted.
- key: PayloadContent
  type: <array>
  presence: required
  content: The array of payload dictionaries. If 'IsEncrypted' is 'true', this array
    isn't needed.
  subkeys:
  - key: PayloadContentItem
    type: <dictionary>
    subkeys:
    - key: ANY
      type: <any>
      presence: required
      content: A payload item as defined by each payload type.
- key: EncryptedPayloadContent
  type: <data>
  presence: optional
  content: Enabled if 'IsEncrypted' is 'true'.
- key: PayloadDescription
  type: <string>
  presence: optional
  content: The description of the profile, shown on the Detail screen for the profile.
    Make this description detailed enough to help the user decide whether to install
    the profile.
- key: PayloadDisplayName
  type: <string>
  presence: optional
  content: The human-readable name for the profile, which doesn't need to be unique.
    The system displays this value on the Detail screen.
- key: HasRemovalPasscode
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: false
  content: Set to 'true' if there's a removal passcode.
- key: PayloadOrganization
  type: <string>
  presence: optional
  content: The human-readable string that contains the name of the organization that
    provided the profile.
- key: PayloadRemovalDisallowed
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      supervised: true
      userenrollment:
        mode: forbidden
    tvOS:
      supervised: true
    visionOS:

  default: false
  content: |-
    If present and set to 'true', the user can't delete the profile unless the profile has a removal password and the user provides it.
    On macOS 10.15 and later, this key only affects removal of manually installed profiles. If set to 'true' and no profile removal payload is present, removing the profile requires admin auth.
    On macOS versions prior to 10.15, this key prevents admins from removing MDM installed profiles. However, as of macOS 10.15, users can never remove MDM profiles, not even the admin.
    On iOS users can't remove a MDM profile.
    Requires a supervised device.
- key: PayloadScope
  supportedOS:
    macOS:
      introduced: '10.8'
  type: <string>
  presence: optional
  rangelist:
  - System
  - User
  content: A string that defines whether to install the profile for the system or
    the user. In many cases, it determines the location of certificate items, such
    as keychains. Though it's not possible to declare different payload scopes, payloads
    like VPN can automatically install their items in both scopes, if needed.
- key: RemovalDate
  type: <date>
  presence: optional
  content: The date when the system automatically removes the profile.
- key: DurationUntilRemoval
  type: <real>
  presence: optional
  content: The number of seconds until the profile is automatically removed. If the
    'RemovalDate' key is present, the system uses whichever field yields the earliest
    date.
- key: PayloadExpirationDate
  supportedOS:
    watchOS:
      introduced: n/a
  type: <date>
  presence: optional
  content: The date when a profile is no longer valid and the system presents an update
    button to the user.

      introduced: '12.2'
    macOS:

  default: 0
  content: |-
    The type of platform of the target device. Specifying the platform type helps prevent unintended installations.
    For interactive installations on iOS devices, specifying a target platform avoids interstitial alerts that prompt the user to choose a profile target when multiple targets are eligible.
    Allowed values:

    * '0': Any/unspecified
    * '1': iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch
    * '2': Apple Watch
    * '3': HomePod
    * '4': Apple TV
    * '5': Mac
    * '6': Vision Pro
- key: ConsentText
  type: <dictionary>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    A dictionary that includes:
    * A key that contains the IETF BCP 47 identifier for a language, such as en or jp
    * A value that contains the agreement localized to language specified by the key
    The dictionary can also contain an optional key, 'default', with its value consisting of the unlocalized (usually in en) agreement.
    The system always displays the agreement in a dialog, and the user needs to agree before the system can install the profile.
    The system chooses a localized version in the order of preference that the user specifies in macOS, or based on the user's current language setting in iOS. If there's no exact match, the system uses the default localization. If there's no default localization, the system uses the en localization. If there's no en localization, the system uses the first available localization.
    Provide a default value, if possible. The system won't display a warning if the user's locale doesn't match any localization in the 'ConsentText' dictionary.
  subkeys:
  - key: ConsentTextItem
    type: <dictionary>
    presence: required
    content: The dictionary containing a key that consists of the IETF BCP 47 identifier
      for a language (for example, en or jp) and a value that consists of the agreement
      localized to that language.
    subkeys:
    - key: ANY
      type: <string>
      presence: required
      content: The key consisting of the IETF BCP 47 identifier for a language (for
        example, en or jp) and the value consisting of the agreement localized to
        that language.
