    Parental controls application restrictions.
    Order of evaluation:
    (1) Certain system applications and utilities are always allowed to run
    (2) The "whiteList" is searched to see if a matching entry is found by bundleID. If a match is found, the "appID" and "detachedSignature"
    (if present) are used to verify the signature of the application being launched. If the signature is valid and matches the designated
    requirement (in the "appID" key), the application is allowed to launch.
    (3) (deprecated) If the path to the binary being launched matches (or is in a subdirectory) of a path in "pathBlackList", the binary is denied.
    (4) (deprecated) If the path to the binary being launched matches (or is a subdirectory) of a path in "pathWhiteList", the binary is allowed to launch.
    (5) The binary is denied permission to launch.
