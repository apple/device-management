  content: Restrictions and settings for SmartCard pairing on macOS
payloadkeys:
- key: UserPairing
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: true
  content: If 'false', users don't get the pairing dialog, although existing pairings
    still work.
- key: allowSmartCard
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: true
  content: If 'false', disables the SmartCard for logins, authorizations, and screen
    saver unlocking. It is still allowed for other functions, such as signing emails
    and accessing the web. A restart is required for a setting change to take effect.
- key: checkCertificateTrust
  type: <integer>
  presence: optional
  rangelist:
  - 0
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
  default: 0
  content: |-
    Valid values are 0 to 3:
    '0': Turns off certificate trust check.
    '1': Turns on certificate trust check. A standard validity check is performed but doesn't include additional revocation checks.
    '2': Turns on certificate trust check. A soft revocation check is also performed. Until the certificate is explicitly rejected by CRL/OCSP, it's considered valid. This setting means that unavailable or unreachable CRL/OCSP allow this check to succeed.
    '3': Turns on certificate trust check. A hard revocation check is also performed. Unless CRL/OCSP explicitly says 'This certificate is OK,' it's considered invalid. This option is the most secure.
- key: oneCardPerUser
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: false
  content: If 'true', a user can pair with only one SmartCard, although existing pairings
    are allowed if already set up.
