  content: Restrictions and settings for SmartCard pairing on macOS
payloadkeys:
- key: UserPairing
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: true
  content: If 'false', users don't get the pairing dialog, although existing pairings
    still work.
- key: allowSmartCard
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: true
  content: If 'false', the system disables the SmartCard for logins, authorizations,
    and screen saver unlocking. It is still allowed for other functions, such as signing
    emails and accessing the web. A restart is required for a setting change to take
    effect.

    Configures the certificate trust check and has one of the following possible values:

    * '0': Turns off certificate trust check.
    * '1': Turns on certificate trust check. A standard validity check is performed but doesn't include additional revocation checks.
    * '2': Turns on certificate trust check. A soft revocation check is also performed. Until the certificate is explicitly rejected by CRL/OCSP, it's considered valid. This setting means that unavailable or unreachable CRL/OCSP allow this check to succeed.
    * '3': Turns on certificate trust check. A hard revocation check is also performed. Unless CRL/OCSP explicitly says “This certificate is OK,” it's considered invalid. This option is the most secure.
