  content: The Xsan preferences payload can be used to configure which volumes automatically
    mount at startup. For StorNext volumes this payload also determines whether the
    mount uses Fibre Channel or Distributed LAN Client (DLC).
payloadkeys:
- key: onlyMount
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: An array of Xsan or StorNext volume names. The Xsan client attempts to
    automatically mount these volumes at startup. The system administrator can mount
    additional volumes manually by using the 'xsanctl(8)' mount command.
  subkeys:
  - key: onlyMountItem
    type: <string>
    presence: required
    content: A volume name.
- key: denyMount
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: An array of Xsan or StorNext volume names. If no 'onlyMount' array is present,
    the Xsan client automatically attempts to mount all SAN volumes except the volumes
    in this array. The system administrator can mount those volumes manually by using
    the 'xsanctl(8)' mount command.
  subkeys:
  - key: denyMountItem
    type: <string>
    presence: required
    content: A volume name.
- key: denyDLC
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: An array of StorNext volume names. If the Xsan client is attempting to
    mount a volume named in this array, the client only mounts the volume if its logical
    units (LUNs) are available through Fibre Channel. It doesn't attempt to mount
    the volume using Distributed LAN Client (DLC).
  subkeys:
  - key: denyDLCItem
    type: <string>
    presence: required
    content: A volume name.
- key: preferDLC
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: An array of StorNext volume names. If the Xsan client is attempting to
    mount a volume named in this array, the Xsan client attempts to mount the volume
    using DLC. If DLC isn't available, the client attempts to mount the volume if
    its LUNs are available through Fibre Channel. The volume name must not also appear
    in 'denyDLC'.
  subkeys:
  - key: preferDLCItem
    type: <string>
    presence: required
    content: A volume name.
- key: useDLC
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: false
  content: If 'true', use the DLC for all volumes.
