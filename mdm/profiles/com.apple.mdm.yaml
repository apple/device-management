    point to a SCEP payload.
- key: Topic
  title: Topic
  type: <string>

  content: The topic that MDM listens to for push notifications. The certificate that
    the server uses to send push notifications must have the same topic in its subject.
    The topic must begin with the 'com.apple.mgmt.' prefix.
- key: ServerURL

    Logical OR of the following bit flags:
    '1': Allow inspection of installed configuration profiles.
    '2': Allow installation and removal of configuration profiles.
    '4': Allow device lock and passcode removal.
    '8': Allow device erase.

    '2048': Allow manipulation of settings.
    '4096': Allow app management.
    The value can't be '0'. If '2' is specified, '1' must also be specified. If '128' is specified, '64' must also be specified.

- key: UseDevelopmentAPNS
  title: Use Development APNS
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: false
  content: |-
    If 'true', the device uses the development APNS servers. Otherwise, the device uses the production servers.
    Note that this property must be set to 'false' if your Apple Push Notification Service certificate was issued by the Apple Push Certificate Portal ('https://identity.apple.com/pushcert'). That portal only issues certificates for the production push environment.

- key: ServerCapabilities
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    A unique array of strings indicating server capabilities. If the server manages macOS devices or a Shared iPad, this field is mandatory and must contain the value 'com.apple.mdm.per-user-connections', which indicates that the server supports both device and user connections.
    Starting with macOS 11, it is also recommended that macOS device enrollment profiles contain the value 'com.apple.mdm.bootstraptoken' to ensure the Bootstrap Token is created and escrowed with the MDM server at enrollment time.
  subkeys:
  - key: ServerCapabilitiesItems
    type: <string>
    rangelist:
    - com.apple.mdm.per-user-connections

    This property specifies an iTunes Store ID for an app the system can install with the InstallApplicationCommand, without any approval from the user. The MDM vendor or managing organization generally provides this app, which enhances the management experience for the user. The device shows the user details about this app in the account-driven enrollment process prior to installing the MDM profile. Use this property with account-driven MDM enrollments that normally require user approval for app installs through MDM.
    Only account-driven user enrollments support this property and other enrollment types ignore it.
    Available in iOS 15.1 and later.
- key: PromptUserToAllowBootstrapTokenForAuthentication
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      introduced: n/a

      introduced: n/a
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: false
  content: |-
    If 'true', warns the user that they need to reboot into RecoveryOS and allow the MDM to use the Bootstrap Token for authentication for certain sensitive operations such as enabling kernel extensions or installing some types of software updates. If the MDM doesn't need to perform these operations, it can leave this key set to 'false', and the user won't be notified.
    The SettingsCommand.Command.Settings.MDMOptions.MDMOptions command overrides this default value.
    This setting only applies to devices that have 'BootstrapTokenRequiredForSoftwareUpdate' or 'BootstrapTokenRequiredForKernelExtensionApproval' set to 'true' in their SecurityInfoResponse.SecurityInfo.
    DEP-enrolled devices are automatically allowed to use the Bootstrap Token for authentication.
    Available in macOS 11 and later.
