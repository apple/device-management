  content: Provides a way of enabling a set of team identifiers or specific system
    extensions for loading without user approval. Also provides a way to block users
    from approving additional system extensions. Payload must be user-approved only.
    Starting in macOS 11.3, installing or removing this payload can change the state
    of system extensions on the machine. If a system extension has been activated
    by its containing application but is still in a pending state, installing a payload
    which specifies that extension is Allowed will complete the activation process.
    If a system extension is active, removing a payload which specified that extension
    was Allowed will deactivate the extension.
payloadkeys:
- key: AllowUserOverrides
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: true
  content: If 'false', restricts users from approving additional system extensions
    that configuration profiles don't explicitly allow.
- key: AllowedTeamIdentifiers
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    An array of team identifiers that defines valid, signed system extensions that are allowable to load. Approved system extensions are those signed with any of the specified team identifiers.
    To avoid requiring an administrator to authorize the operation, you can activate system extensions that this key specifies using activationRequest(forExtensionWithIdentifier:queue:).
    It's an error for the same team identifier to appear in both this array and as a key in the 'AllowedSystemExtensions' dictionary.
  subkeys:
  - key: AllowedTeamIdentifiersItem
    title: Identifier
    type: <string>
- key: AllowedSystemExtensionTypes
  type: <dictionary>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    A dictionary that maps a team identifier to an array of strings, where each string is a type of system extension that you can install for that team identifier. The allowed extension types are 'DriverExtension', 'NetworkExtension', and 'EndpointSecurityExtension'.
    If there's no entry for a specified team identifier in the dictionary, the system allows all extension types.
  subkeys:
  - key: ANY
    type: <array>
    presence: optional
    content: The mapping of team identifier to an array of strings, where each string
      is a type of system extension that may be installed for that team identifier.
    subkeys:
    - key: AllowedSystemExtensionTypesItems
      type: <string>
      presence: required
      content: Permitted System Extension Type
- key: AllowedSystemExtensions
  type: <dictionary>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    A dictionary of approved system extensions on the computer. The dictionary maps the team identifiers (keys) to arrays of bundle identifiers, where the bundle identifier defines the system extension to install.
    To avoid requiring an administrator to authorize the operation, you can activate system extensions that this key specifies using activationRequest(forExtensionWithIdentifier:queue:).
    It's an error for the same team identifier to appear in both the 'AllowedTeamIdentifiers' array and as a key in this dictionary.
  subkeys:
  - key: ANY
    type: <array>
    presence: optional
    content: The mapping of team identifiers to arrays of bundle identifiers, where
      the bundle identifier is that of the system extension to be installed.
    subkeys:
    - key: AllowedSystemExtensionsItems
      type: <string>
      presence: required
      content: Allowed system extension bundle ID
- key: RemovableSystemExtensions
  supportedOS:
    macOS:
      introduced: '12.0'
  type: <dictionary>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    A dictionary of system extensions that are allowed to remove themselves from the machine. The dictionary maps team identifiers (keys) to arrays of bundle identifiers, where the bundle identifier defines the system extension. An application using the 'OSSystemExtensionDeactivationRequest' API can deactivate the specified system extensions without requiring an administrator to authorize the operation.
    Available in macOS 12 and later.
  subkeys:
  - key: ANY
    type: <array>
    presence: optional
    content: The dictionary maps team identifiers (keys) to arrays of bundle identifiers,
      where the bundle identifier defines the system extension.
    subkeys:
    - key: RemovableSystemExtensionsItems
      type: <string>
      presence: required
      content: Removed system extension bundle ID
- key: NonRemovableSystemExtensions
  supportedOS:
    macOS:
      introduced: '15.0'
  type: <dictionary>
  presence: optional
  content: A dictionary of system extensions on the computer. The dictionary maps
    the team identifiers (keys) to arrays of bundle identifiers, where the bundle
    identifier defines the system extension which cannot be disabled or uninstalled
    when SIP is enabled. It's an error for the same mapping to appear in the dictionary
    values corresponding to 'RemovableSystemExtensions' and 'NonRemovableSystemExtensions'
    keys.
  subkeys:
  - key: ANY
    type: <array>
    presence: optional
    content: System extension bundle identifiers
    subkeys:
    - key: NonRemovableSystemExtensionsItems
      type: <string>
      presence: required
      content: Non Removable system extension bundle ID
- key: NonRemovableFromUISystemExtensions
  supportedOS:
    macOS:
      introduced: '15.0'
  type: <dictionary>
  presence: optional
  content: A dictionary of system extensions on the computer. The dictionary maps
    the team identifiers (keys) to arrays of bundle identifiers, where the bundle
    identifier defines the system extension which cannot be disabled or uninstalled
    from System Settings or Finder. The set of system extensions between 'RemovableSystemExtensions'
    and 'NonRemovableFromUISystemExtensions' are allowed to overlap.
  subkeys:
  - key: ANY

    subkeys:
