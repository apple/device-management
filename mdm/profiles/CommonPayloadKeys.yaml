payloadkeys:
- key: PayloadIdentifier
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: |-
    The reverse-DNS-style identifier for the payload. This identifier is usually the same as the TopLevel value, with an additional appended component. This string must be unique within the profile.
    During a profile replacement, the system updates payloads with the same 'PayloadIdentifier' and 'PayloadUUID' in the old and new profiles.
- key: PayloadUUID
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: |-
    The globally unique identifier for the payload. The actual content is unimportant, but must be globally unique. In macOS, use 'uuidgen' to generate UUIDs.
    During a profile replacement, the system updates payloads with the same 'PayloadIdentifier' and 'PayloadUUID' in the old and new profiles.
- key: PayloadType
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: The payload type, which each payload domain's reference page specifies.
- key: PayloadVersion
  type: <integer>
  presence: required
  rangelist:
  - 1
  content: The version of this specific payload.
- key: PayloadDescription
  type: <string>
  presence: optional
  content: The human-readable description of this payload. This description appears
    on the Detail screen.
- key: PayloadDisplayName
  type: <string>
  presence: optional
  content: The human-readable name for the profile payload. The name appears on the
    Detail screen and doesn't need to be unique.
- key: PayloadOrganization
  type: <string>
  presence: optional
  content: The human-readable string containing the name of the organization that
    provides the profile. This value doesn't need to match the organization payload
    value in the enclosing dictionary.
