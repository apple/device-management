  title: Allow Simple Value
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
    visionOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: true
  content: If 'false', the system prevents use of a simple passcode. A simple passcode
    contains repeated characters, or increasing or decreasing characters, such as
    '123' or 'CBA'.
- key: forcePIN
  title: Require Passcode on Device
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
    visionOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: false
  content: If 'true', the system forces the user to enter a PIN.
- key: maxFailedAttempts
  title: Maximum Number of Failed Attempts
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
    visionOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
  type: <integer>
  presence: optional
  range:
    min: 2
    max: 11
  default: 11
  content: The number of allowed failed attempts to enter the passcode at the device's
    lock screen. After four failed attempts, the system imposes a time delay before
    a passcode can be entered again. The delay increases with each attempt. In macOS,
    set 'minutesUntilFailedLoginReset' to define a delay before the next passcode
    can be entered. When this number is exceeded in macOS, the system locks the device;
    in iOS, the system wipes the device.
- key: maxInactivity
  title: Auto-Lock
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
    visionOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
  type: <integer>
  presence: optional
  range:
    min: 0
    max: 15
  content: |-
    The maximum number of minutes for which the device can be idle without the user unlocking it, before the system locks it. When this limit is reached, the system locks the device and the passcode is required to unlock it. The user can edit this setting, but the value can't exceed the 'maxInactivity' value.
    In macOS, the system translates this inactivity value to screen-saver settings. The maximum value for macOS is '60'.
    Setting this key removes the 'never' option in the Settings UI on user enrolled devices.
- key: maxPINAgeInDays
  title: Maximum Passcode Age
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
    visionOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
  type: <integer>
  presence: optional
  range:
    min: 0
    max: 730
  content: The number of days for which the passcode can remain unchanged. After this
    number of days, the system forces the user to change the passcode before it unlocks
    the device.
- key: minComplexChars
  title: Minimum Number of Complex Characters
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored

    watchOS:
      introduced: n/a
  type: <integer>
  presence: optional
  range:
    min: 0
    max: 4
  default: 0
  content: |-
    The minimum number of complex characters that a passcode needs to contain. A complex character is a character other than a number or a letter, such as '&', '%', '$', and '#'.
    The system ignores this property for User Enrollments.
- key: minLength
  title: Minimum Passcode Length
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
    visionOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
  type: <integer>
  presence: optional
  range:
    min: 0
    max: 16
  default: 0
  content: The minimum overall length of the passcode. This value is independent of
    the value for 'minComplexChars'.
- key: requireAlphanumeric
  title: Require Alphabetic Value
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
    visionOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
    watchOS:
      introduced: n/a
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: false
  content: If 'true', the system requires alphabetic characters instead of only numeric
    characters.
- key: pinHistory
  title: Passcode History
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
    visionOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
  type: <integer>
  presence: optional
  range:
    min: 1
    max: 50
  content: This value defines N, where the new passcode must be unique within the
    last N entries in the passcode history.
- key: maxGracePeriod
  title: Grace Period for Device Lock
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
    visionOS:
      userenrollment:
        mode: ignored
  type: <integer>
  presence: optional
  default: 0
  content: The maximum grace period, in minutes, to unlock the phone without entering
    a passcode. The default is '0', which is no grace period and requires a passcode
    immediately. In macOS, the system translates this grace period value to screen-saver
    settings.
- key: minutesUntilFailedLoginReset
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      introduced: n/a
    macOS:
      introduced: '10.10'

    visionOS:
      introduced: n/a
    watchOS:
      introduced: n/a
  type: <integer>
  presence: optional
  content: The number of minutes before the system resets the login after the maximum
    number of unsuccessful login attempts is reached. This key requires setting 'maxFailedAttempts'.
    Available in macOS 10.10 and later.
- key: changeAtNextAuth
  supportedOS:
    iOS:
      introduced: n/a
    macOS:
      introduced: '10.13'

        mode: ignored
    visionOS:
      introduced: n/a
    watchOS:
      introduced: n/a
  type: <boolean>
  presence: optional
  default: false
  content: If 'true', the system causes a password reset to occur the next time the
    user tries to authenticate. If this key is set in a device profile, the setting
    takes effect for all users, and admin authentications may fail until the admin
    user password is also reset. Available in macOS 10.13 and later.
- key: customRegex

    watchOS:
      introduced: n/a
  type: <dictionary>
  presence: optional
  content: |-
    Specifies a regular expression, and its description, used to enforce password compliance. Use the simpler passcode restrictions whenever possible, and rely on regular expression matching only when necessary. Mistakes in regular expressions can lead to frustrating user experiences, such as unsatisfiable passcode policies, or policy descriptions that don't match the enforced policy.
    Available in macOS 14 and later.
  subkeys:
  - key: passwordContentRegex
    type: <string>
    presence: required
    content: A regular expression string that the system matches against the password
      to determine whether it complies with a policy. The regular expression uses
      the ICU syntax (<https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/strings/regexp.html>).
      The string must not exceed 2048 characters in length.
  - key: passwordContentDescription
    type: <dictionary>
    presence: optional
    content: Contains a dictionary of keys for supported OS language IDs (for example,
      “en-US”), and whose values represent a localized description of the policy enforced
      by the regular expression. Use the special 'default' key can for languages that
      aren't contained in the dictionary.
    subkeys:
    - key: ANY
      type: <string>
      presence: optional
      content: A localized description.
