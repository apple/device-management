    The type of the VPN, which defines which settings are appropriate for this VPN payload.
    If the type is 'VPN' or 'TransparentProxy', then the system requires a value for 'VPNSubType'.
    'TransparentProxy' is only available in macOS. 'L2TP' and 'IPSec' aren't available in tvOS. 'AlwaysOn' is only available on iOS and Apple Watch pairing isn't supported with 'AlwaysOn'.

      If '1', enables NAT keepalive offload for Always On VPN IKEv2 connections. The device sends keepalive packets to maintain NAT mappings for IKEv2 connections that have a NAT on the path. It sends keepalive packets at regular intervals when the device is awake. If 'NATKeepAliveOffloadEnable' is '1', the system offloads keepalive packets to hardware while the device is asleep.
      NAT keepalive offload has an impact on the battery life due to the extra workload during sleep. The default interval for the keepalive offload packets is 20 seconds over WiFi and 110 seconds over Cellular interface. The default NAT keepalive works well on networks with small NAT mapping timeouts but imposes a potential battery impact. If a network has larger NAT mapping timeouts, larger keepalive intervals may be safely used to minimize battery impact. Modify the keepalive interval through the 'NATKeepAliveInterval' key.
