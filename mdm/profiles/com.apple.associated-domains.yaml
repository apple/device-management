  content: Configures Associated Domains to be used with features such as Extensible
    AppSSO, universal links and Password AutoFill. Settings are per-user. The effective
    settings for a user will be the union of payloads installed for the device and
    the user. Users on a system that are not managed by the MDM will not have any
    effective settings, not even those from device payloads.
