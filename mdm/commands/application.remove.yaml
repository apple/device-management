    The bundle identifier of the managed app.
    For a watchOS app, the identifier needs to be the watch's bundle identifier, which differs from the main bundle identifier for the iPhone to which the watch is paired. Obtain the watch's bundle identifier for an app with a watch bundle, in the 'watchBundleId' key that's part of the Content Metadata query. For more information on this query, see Getting App and Book Information (Legacy).
