title: Certificate List Command
description: This command allows the server to retrieve the list of installed certificates
  on the device. The command requires that the server has the Inspect Profile Manifest
  privilege. For userenrollment, this request will limit to certificates pushed via
  MDM. Starting with iOS 15.4, the CertificateList command will return a Not Now response
  prior to the first time a passcode-protected device is unlocked after boot. Between
  iOS 15.0 and iOS 15.4, devices in that state did not respond with Not Now, but some
  identity certificates may not have been reported in the response.
