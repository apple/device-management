title: Install Application Command
description: This command allows the server to install an application on a device.
  If the app is already being managed, this command will update the app. Prior to
  iOS 16.0 and tvOS 16.0, this command would return NotNow when Setup Assistant was
  running. Starting in iOS 16.0 and tvOS 16.0, the command may be sent to supervised
  devices during Setup Assistant. However, you should only attempt to install device-based
  VPP apps or enterprise apps while in the awaiting configuration state, as the device
  will likely not yet have an App Store account configured, and thus commands that
  depend on one will fail.
