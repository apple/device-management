    The URL of the profile to download and install. This must be an 'https://' URL. The system silently ignores any account or passcode payloads in the profile. Use their declarative configurations instead.
    If a user enrollment triggers this configuration, the system silently ignores any MDM 1 payloads in macOS where the User Enrollment Mode setting is 'forbidden'. In iOS, the system rejects the entire profile.
