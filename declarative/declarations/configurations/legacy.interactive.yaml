    The URL of the profile to download and install. This must be an 'https://' URL that is hosted by the MDM server. When fetching the profile data, the device will use standard MDM authentication for the HTTP request.
    If a user enrollment triggers this configuration, the system silently ignores any MDM 1 payloads in macOS where the User Enrollment Mode setting is 'forbidden'. In iOS and tvOS, the system rejects the entire profile.

  title: Configuration Visible Name
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: The visible name of the configuration. This name needs to indicate the
    nature of the profile.
