  content: When set to "true", this indicates that the status report contains the
    full set of current status, and is not an incremental report. This will include
    the full set of items in any status array item (not just the changes). Servers
    can use this to replace their entire set of status for the device, rather than
    do incremental update processing. Devices will set this to "true" when sending
    a "safety sync" status report, which is typically sent every 24 hours or so.
