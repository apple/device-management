  type: <boolean>
  presence: required
  content: If 'true', a passcode is present on the device. If 'false', a passcode
    isn't present on the device. When a passcode is present, the specific attributes
    of the passcode (length, number of complex characters, etc), isn't reported. Instead,
    use the 'passcode.is-compliant' status item to verify that the passcode complies
    with all passcode policies set on the device.
